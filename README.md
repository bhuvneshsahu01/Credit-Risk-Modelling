# Credit Risk Modelling

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of credit risk modelling techniques. The aim of this project is to predict the probability of default for loan applicants using various statistical and machine learning approaches. The dataset used in this project includes features related to borrowers' credit history, personal information, and loan details.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand dataset characteristics.
- Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Implementation of various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- Visualization of model performance and feature importance.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and modelling.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
